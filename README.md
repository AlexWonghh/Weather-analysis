# API Data Analysis Project: Global Warming & Weather Trends

## Overview

This README provides an overview of the project task described in the PDF file `API Poster Task - Data Analyst.pdf`. The project focuses on using the Meteo API library to collect, analyze, and visualize weather data for investigating global warming trends. It emphasizes data-driven insights into temperature changes, seasonal shifts, and other patterns, primarily in Hong Kong, with an extension to a user-chosen location.

The goal is to produce a report and visual presentation (e.g., a poster) supported by graphs and charts, highlighting evidence of global warming through historical and recent weather data.

**PDF Details:**
- Filename: `API Poster Task - Data Analyst.pdf`
- Total Pages: 2
- Content: Project objectives, analysis guidelines, deliverables, and encouraged additions.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the Meteo API library (for fetching weather data).
- Proficiency in Python, including libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.
- Optional: Knowledge of data analysis techniques (e.g., trend analysis, correlations) using tools like NumPy or SciPy.

## Project Structure

### Part 1: Hong Kong Analysis

Use yearly weather data from 1990 to 2025 to address the following questions:

1. **Temperature Trends**
   - Has the average temperature generally increased over time?

2. **Seasonal Changes**
   - Do the seasons appear different compared to the past?
   - Is winter colder, warmer, or shorter than before?

3. **Other Observations**
   - Any unusual trends, changes in variability, or other noteworthy patterns?

### Part 2: Your Chosen Location

Select another weather station or location (anywhere in the world) and investigate similar aspects:
- How do temperature or seasonal changes appear there?
- Identify an interesting metric for comparison (e.g., rainfall, extreme heat days, humidity).
- Perform a comparison with Hong Kong (or multiple locations if feasible).

## Deliverables

1. **Report on Hong Kong’s Global Warming Situation**
   - Include detailed analysis, explanations, and insights based on the data.

2. **Extra Section for Your Chosen Location**
   - Present findings, comparisons, and any unique observations.

3. **Visual Presentation (Poster)**
   - Use graphs, charts, or other visuals to clearly illustrate your analysis.
   - Tip: Search for tutorials on creating graphs from Pandas DataFrames in Python (e.g., line plots for trends, bar charts for comparisons).

## Encouraged Additions

- Explore correlations (e.g., between temperature and rainfall).
- Combine or compare data from multiple locations for broader insights.
- Highlight any surprising or interesting findings in the data to add depth to your report.

## How to Get Started

1. **Data Collection**: Use the Meteo API to fetch yearly weather data for Hong Kong (1990–2025) and your chosen location.
2. **Analysis**: Load data into Pandas, compute averages, trends, and metrics (e.g., seasonal breakdowns, variability via standard deviation).
3. **Visualization**: Generate plots using Matplotlib or similar libraries. Consider time-series line graphs for temperature trends or heatmaps for seasonal changes.
4. **Reporting**: Compile your findings into a structured report (e.g., Markdown, Word, or PDF) and create a poster (e.g., using Canva, PowerPoint, or Python libraries like Plotly for interactive visuals).
5. **Validation**: Ensure data accuracy by cross-referencing with reliable sources if needed.

By completing this project, you'll gain hands-on experience in API usage, data analysis, and visualization while contributing insights on global warming trends.
